## Chapter 1 : Transportation in animals and plants.

### Blood
Blood is the body's major medium of transport, it a fluid that can circulate.
It does a lot of functions that is essential for life, namely

* Carrying oxygen to all parts of the body
* Collecting wastes such as urea and carbon-di-oxide
* It distributes energy rich vitamins and minerals to all parts of the body

Blood is made up of

* _plasma_ : Fluid that transports substances throughout the blood, it also helps in clotting of blood

* _RBC_ : Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of the body

* _WBC_ : White blood cells protect the body against infections by fighting with foreign bodies

* _Platelets_ : Helps blood to clot

### Heart
Heart is a pump that pumps blood to all parts of the body. Blood flows through pipe
like structures called artries and veins (These are generally called blood vesseles) 

1. Artries carry oxygenated blood from heart to body.
2. Veins carry De-oxygenatd blood from body to heart.
3. Capillaries connect Artries and veins. 


### Structure of Heart
The heart is made up of four chambers.

1. Right Auricle
2. Left Auricle
3. Right Ventricle
4. Left Ventricle

Heart has 5 pipe like structures (Helping in the transportation of blood), which are

1. _Superior vena cava_ : Help in bringing de-oxygenated blood to the heart
2. _Inferior vena cava_ : Help in bringing de-oxygenated blood to the heart
3. _Aorta_ : Help in pumping the blood to all parts of body
4. _Pulmonary vein_ : Help in pumping the blood to all parts of the body
5. _Pulmonary artery_ : Help in pumping the de-oxygenated blood to lungs

The phase when both the oxygenated and the de-oxygenated blood enters the heart through the _superior vena cava_ and _inferior vena cava_ is called *Diastole*
The phase when they are pumped out of _pulmonary artery_ and _aorta_ is called *Systole*
